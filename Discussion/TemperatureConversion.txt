1. I decided to make the welcome and quit messages their own methods, since those statements can be called multiple times throughout the code. 

2. I made two separate methods for calculating the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures. Since these are both methods that the application will use frequently, it made sense that these would be independent methods. All the statements, which included: displaying messages to the user, saving their input, calculating the conversion of temperatures back and forth (to Fahrenheit and Celsius), and finally being able to display the calculations were made into their respective coding blocks.

There are a plethora of advantages for using methods in one's code. Methods greatly simplifies both the readability, code execution, and reduces the time it takes to build an application. I also would argue, as it has been said many times before, that methods greatly improves the code's overall efficiency. Lastly, methods greatly enhance the robustness a program's code! It adds the ability for users to carry out complex tasks (whether they be mathematical or not), and work with large components of data. Using methods allows for the ability to work without any limits on what one can accomplish!
